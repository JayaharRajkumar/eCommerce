# Spring Boot eCommerce Web App

## About

This is a demo project for practicing Spring + Thymeleaf. The idea was to build some basic shopping cart web app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Thymeleaf**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Data REST and Docker**. 
Database is in memory **H2**.

There is a login and registration functionality included.

Users can shop for products. Each user has his own shopping cart (session functionality).
Checkout is transactional.

## Configuration

### Configuration Files

Folder **src/resources/** contains config files for Spring Boot application.

* **src/resources/application.properties** - main configuration file. Here it is possible to change admin username/password,
as well as change the port number.

## How to run

There are several ways to run the application. You can run it from the command line with included Maven Wrapper, Maven or Docker. 

Once the app starts, go to the web browser and visit `http://localhost:8070/home`

Admin username: **admin**

Admin password: **admin**

User username: **user**

User password: **password**

## Helper Tools

### HAL REST Browser
